General purpose map voting plugin, started as a simple RTV and now has more features

# Enjoying the plugin?
Please drop a ⭐ star in the repository 

> [!WARNING]
> Notes from Oz-Lin:
> 
> This fork of the plugin mainly considers ZE/ZM/ZR Zombie Escape/Survival/Riot, or any round-based game modes.
>
> Now testing for non-round-based modes such as bhop/surf/kz/mg-course! Make sure both `mp_timelimit` and `mp_roundtime` has the same value. 
>
> ~~For non-round-based modes such as bhop/surf/kz/mg-course, I cannot guarantee your use case.~~ Please double-check your server cvar configs (such as `mp_timelimit`, `mp_maxrounds` etc, along with `TriggerSecondsBeforeEnd` and `TriggerRoundsBeforeEnd` in config.json) in case of compatibility issues.

# Configs
- A config file will be created in `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/RockTheVote` the first time you load the plugin.
- Changes in the config file will require you to reload the plugin or restart the server (change the map won't work).
- Maps that will be used in RTV/nominate/votemap/end of map vote are located in `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/RockTheVote/maplist.txt` (rename `maplist.example.txt` to `maplist.txt`)

## General config
| Config         | Description                                                                      | Default Value | Min | Max |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --- | --- |
| MapsInCoolDown | Number of maps that can't be used in vote because they have been played recently | 3             | 0   |     |

## RockTheVote
Players can type rtv to request the map to be changed, once a number of votes is reached (by default 60% of players in the server) a vote will start for the next map, this vote lasts up to 30 seconds (hardcoded for now), in the end server changes to the winner map.

# Adding workshop maps
- If you are not hosting a collection in order to add workshop maps you need to know it's id and add as following in the maplist.txt file: `<mapname>:<workshop-id>`.
- If you are already hosting a collection and can change to workshop maps using the command `ds_workshop_changelevel <map-name>` you don't need the ID, just put the actual map name and it will work.
    - However, it's still recommended to add the ID	if you plan to modify the display map name.

# Server commands

- rtv [seconds] - Trigger a map vote externally that will change the map immediately with an optional seconds parameter for voting duration (useful for gamemodes like GunGame)

# Admin commands
- css_extend [minutes] - Extend the current map time limit mp_timelimit by minutes 

# Vip commands
Requires "@css/vip" permission
- css_ve or css_voteextend - Vote to initialise extending the current map

# Limitations
 - Plugins is still under development and a lot of functionality is still going to be added in the future.
 - I usually test the new versions in an empty server with bots so it is hard to tell if everything is actually working, feel free to post any issues here or in the discord thread so I can fix them https://discord.com/channels/1160907911501991946/1176224458751627514
